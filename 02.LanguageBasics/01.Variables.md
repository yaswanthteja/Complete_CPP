## What is an Identifier?

An identifier is the **name** you give to elements in your program such as variables, functions, classes, arrays, etc.

* **Purpose** : It uniquely identifies these entities so you can reference them in your code.
* **Examples** : `age`, `salary`, `main`, `Student`, `calculateSum`.

## 🔹 Rules for Identifiers in C++

1. **Allowed Characters**
   * Can contain  **letters (A–Z, a–z)** ,  **digits (0–9)** , and  **underscore ** `_`.
   * Example: `student1`, `total_sum`.
2. **Must Start with a Letter or Underscore**
   * Cannot start with a digit.
   * ✅ `age1`
   * ❌ `1age`
3. **Case-Sensitive**
   * `Age`, `age`, and `AGE` are all different identifiers.
   * Example: `int Age = 10; int age = 20;` → two separate variables.
4. **No Special Characters**
   * Symbols like `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&` are not allowed.
   * Only `_` is permitted.
5. **Cannot Use Reserved Keywords**
   * Words like `int`, `float`, `class`, `return` cannot be used as identifiers.
   * ❌ `int int = 5;` → invalid.
6. **Length**
   * No strict limit, but should be meaningful and not excessively long.
   * Example: `customerAccountBalance` is valid but descriptive.
7. **No Spaces**
   * Identifiers cannot contain spaces.
   * ❌ `student name` → invalid
   * ✅ `student_name` → valid






# Variables

 In C++, a **variable** is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. It has a **type** (like `int`, `double`, `char`, `string`, `bool`) which defines what kind of data it can store, and a **name** (identifier) that you use to access it.

## Technical Definition

* A **variable** is a container for storing data values.
* **Syntax** :

```
  type variableName = value;
```

* `type` → data type (e.g., `int`, `double`)
* `variableName` → identifier (e.g., `x`, `age`)
* `value` → optional initial value

## 🔹 Types of Variables in C++

Common built-in types include:

| Type       | Description                         | Example                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `int`    | Stores integers (whole numbers)     | `int age = 25;`             |
| `double` | Stores floating-point numbers       | `double pi = 3.14;`         |
| `char`   | Stores single characters            | `char grade = 'A';`         |
| `string` | Stores text (requires `<string>`) | `string name = "Yaswanth";` |
| `bool`   | Stores true/false values            | `bool isReady = true;`      |

## 🔹 Variable Declaration vs Initialization

* **Declaration** : Telling the compiler about the variable.
  cpp

```
  intnum;   // declared but not initialized
```

* **Initialization** : Assigning a value at the time of declaration.
  cpp

```
  intnum = 10;   // declared and initialized
```

You can also assign later:

cpp

```
num = 20;   // value updated
```

## 🔹 Example Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
usingnamespacestd;

int main() {
    intage = 22;          // integer variable
    doublesalary = 50000; // floating-point variable
    chargrade = 'A';      // character variable
    string name = "Yaswanth"; // string variable
    boolisActive = true;  // boolean variable

    cout << "Name: "<< name << endl;
    cout << "Age: "<< age << endl;
    cout << "Salary: "<< salary << endl;
    cout << "Grade: "<< grade << endl;
    cout << "Active: "<< isActive << endl;

    return0;
}
```

**Output:**

Code

```
Name: Yaswanth
Age: 22
Salary: 50000
Grade: A
Active: 1
```

## 🔹 Key Notes

* **Scope** : Variables exist only within the block `{}` they are defined in.
* **Lifetime** : Depends on where they are declared (local vs global).
* **Naming rules** : Must start with a letter or underscore, cannot use reserved keywords.
* **Multiple variables** : You can declare multiple of the same type in one line:
  cpp

```
  intx = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
```

Variables in C++ are named memory locations with a type and value. They are the foundation of all programs, allowing you to store, manipulate, and retrieve data

### 1. **Visual Studio (MSVC)**

* **What it is** : Full IDE with Microsoft’s official C++ compiler.
* **Steps** :

1. Download **Visual Studio Community Edition** from [Microsoft Visual Studio.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
2. During installation, select **“Desktop development with C++”** workload.
3. After installation, you can create and run C++ projects directly.

* **Best for** : Beginners, large projects, GUI apps, debugging.

### 2. **MinGW-w64 (GCC for Windows)**

* **What it is** : Lightweight GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) port for Windows.
* **Steps** :

1. Download from [MinGW-w64 SourceForge.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
2. Install and add the `bin` folder path (e.g., `C:\mingw-w64\bin`) to your  **System PATH** .
3. Open Command Prompt and run:
   bash

   ```
   g++ --version
   ```

   to verify installation.

* **Best for** : Command-line development, lightweight setups, scripting.

# 3. MSYS2

[Download MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

MSYS2 provides up-to-date native builds for GCC, mingw-w64, CPython, CMake, Meson, OpenSSL, FFmpeg, Rust, Ruby, just to name a few.

## ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

* **PATH setup** : For MinGW-w64 or other compilers, you must add the compiler’s `bin` directory to your PATH environment variable.
* **IDE vs CLI** : Visual Studio is heavy but beginner-friendly; MinGW-w64 is lightweight but requires command-line usage.
